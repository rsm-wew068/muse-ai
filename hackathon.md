🚀 Are you ready to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the cloud?

Join us for a high-energy hackathon where Google Cloud takes center stage. This is your chance to experiment with cutting-edge AI, machine learning, and cloud technologies built to help you create, scale, and launch transformative ideas.

Tap into powerful data analytics, secure storage, and enterprise-grade security while exploring curated and public datasets. With Google Cloud’s advanced AI tools at your fingertips, you’ll have everything you need to turn bold concepts into breakthrough projects.

We're thrilled to be partnering with Datadog, Confluent, and ElevenLabs for this hackathon!

REQUIREMENTS
WHAT TO BUILD

Build a new working application that tackles one of the challenges provided by one of the partners. Your submission must integrate both Google Cloud products (Vertex AI, Gemini, etc.) and the specific Partner’s technologies to deliver a compelling and innovative solution. 

Datadog Challenge: Using Datadog, implement an innovative end-to-end observability monitoring strategy for an LLM application (new or reused) of your choice, powered by Vertex AI or Gemini. Stream LLM and runtime telemetry to Datadog, define detection rules, and present a clear dashboard that surfaces application health and the observability/security signals you consider essential. When any detection rule is triggered, leverage Datadog to define an actional item (e.g., case, incident, alert, etc.) with context for an AI engineer to act on.

You have full access to Datadog, be creative in how you leverage the platform and the telemetry you emit.


Confluent Challenge: Unleash the power of AI on data in motion! Your challenge is to build a next-generation AI application using Confluent and Google Cloud. Apply advanced AI/ML models to any real-time data stream to generate predictions, create dynamic experiences, or solve a compelling problem in a novel way. Demonstrate how real-time data unlocks real-world challenges with AI.


ElevenLabs Challenge: Use ElevenLabs and Google Cloud AI to make your app conversational, intelligent, and voice-driven. Combine ElevenLabs Agents with Google Cloud Vertex AI or Gemini to give your app a natural, human voice and personality — enabling users to interact entirely through speech. You can integrate ElevenLabs’ APIs directly into your app using our React SDK or via server-side calls hosted on Google Cloud.

Please double check our Resources tab for full details of all challenges. 

WHAT TO SUBMIT
